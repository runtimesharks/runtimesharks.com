			Would you like to learn programming? No matter the language, let us help
			you! We will start with an intro session, where we'll understand your
			goals. We'll then work together a suggested of 2–3 times/week and get you
			up and running with the basics. At the end, you should be able to apply to
			any junior position. If you'd like to continue after that, we'd be happy
			to!
